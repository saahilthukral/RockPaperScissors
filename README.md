# RockPaperScissors
This is a newer version of the Rock Paper Scissors game I have created by combining HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This is still quite basic, but Ialso use DOM manipulation, along with basic JavaScript code


# Note: This was the README.md for the older version of the RPS program
This is a super barebones edition of Rock Paper Scissors I created from JavaScript. Over time, I will work on it and convert it to a GUI

This version does not use loops and is the most basi version possible.
